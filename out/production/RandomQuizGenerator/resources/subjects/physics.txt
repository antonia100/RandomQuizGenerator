Radiocarbon is produced in the atmosphere as a result of|collision between fast neutrons and nitrogen nuclei present in the atmosphere|action of ultraviolet light from the sun on atmospheric oxygen|action of solar radiations particularly cosmic rays on carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere|lightning discharge in atmosphere|0
It is easier to roll a stone up a sloping road than to lift it vertical upwards because|work done in rolling is more than in lifting|work done in lifting the stone is equal to rolling it|work done in both is same but the rate of doing work is less in rolling|work done in rolling a stone is less than in lifting it|3
